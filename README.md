# Getting Started with Create React App
# git clone repo or see deployed versions on heroku
# run npm install & npm start for server & client dir locally to begin

# Overview of current Application, potential implementations/planning next steps:

# Why hooks? split state vs class OOP with SOLID design priciples
# Redux/context api for app as size starts to increase
# Acessability - semantic HTML and alt/aria labels bare minimum
# Testing Jest/React testing lib for snapshot/integration, e2e testing w Cypress
# Error handling - could use Redux form/React hook form, used try catch blocks
# Server vs Client side routing, SEO and spped w server, no lazy loading yet
# Edge cases beyond above? axios has cross browser support vs fetch api, others
# ES Lint, prettier, and modules with exportable funcitons for readability
# Design UI/UX could use Figma to import CSS vs styled comp/material ui/bootstrap for support cross browser, code splitting with webpack and minified files 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
